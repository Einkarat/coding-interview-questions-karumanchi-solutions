# Solutions for "Coding Interview Questions by Narasimha Karamanchi" 1st edition
This repo is the collection of my solutions for the problems given in the book. I have not posted the questions in code files in order to keep the writer happy. And I encourage people to [buy the book](http://www.amazon.in/Coding-Interview-Questions-Narasimha-Karumanchi/dp/8192107515)

# Running the code
The solutions are in C++. Please use g++ to compile the programs.
```sh
g++ -std=c++11 q32.cpp -o output.o
./output.o 2
```
-std=c++11 is to include everything which is under the sun.

# Code files
Code for every chapter is inside the respective directory of topic. Every directory contains a header file which contains all the classes/structs/methods for the basic/advanced operations on given data structure. This file contains most of the meat. Please make sure that you go through these files.
